# Predicting House Prices 
Using python

Great project! Here's a detailed plan for each step you mentioned:

# 1. Data Collection
  Sources: Look for datasets on Kaggle, Zillow, or government housing agencies. Ensure the dataset contains features like square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, etc.
  Example Dataset: [Kaggle House Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

# 2. Data Exploration
  Tools : Use pandas and matplotlib/seaborn in Python.
  Tasks: 
  - Load the dataset and use `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to understand the structure.Check for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.
  - Visualize the distribution of house prices and other numerical features using histograms and box plots.
  - Analyze relationships between features using scatter plots and correlation matrices.

# 3. Data Preprocessing
  Handling Missing Values: 
  - For numerical features, you can use mean/median imputation or fill with a specific value.
  - For categorical features, you can use the mode or a placeholder category.
    Outliers: Detect and handle outliers using methods like the Z-score or IQR.
  Encoding Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables like neighborhoods.

# 4. Feature Selection
  Correlation Matrix: Use `seaborn.heatmap` to visualize the correlation matrix and identify features with high correlation to house prices.
  Feature Importance: If using tree-based models, you can extract feature importance scores.
  Domain Knowledge : Consider the domain knowledge and intuition about which features might impact house prices.

# 5. Model Selection
  Regression Algorithms: Start with Linear Regression, and then experiment with more complex models like Decision Tree Regression and Random Forest Regression.
  Libraries: Use scikit-learn for implementation.

# 6. Data Split
Train-Test Split: Use `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to split the data (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

# 7. Model Training
  Training: Fit the chosen regression model to the training data.
  Example Code:
  ```python
  from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

# 8. Model Evaluation
  Metrics: Use MAE, MSE, and RMSE to evaluate model performance.
  Example Code  :
  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error
  import numpy as np

  y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
  mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
  mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
  rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
  ```

# 9. Prediction
  New Data: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data points.
  Example Code:
  ```python
  new_data = [[2000, 3, 'Neighborhood_X']]
  new_data_transformed = preprocessor.transform(new_data)  # Apply the same preprocessing steps
  price_prediction = model.predict(new_data_transformed)
  ```

# 10. Visualization
  Scatter Plots**: Plot features vs. house prices.
  Regression Plots**: Use seaborn's `regplot` for visualizing the regression line.

# 11. Model Tuning
  Hyperparameters: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from scikit-learn to find the best hyperparameters.
  Example Code  :
  ```python
  from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

  param_grid = {'param1': [value1, value2], 'param2': [value3, value4]}
  grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
  grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)
  best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_
  ```

# 12. Documentation
  Report: Document each step, including the dataset source, preprocessing steps, model selection rationale, and evaluation results.

  Tools: Use Jupyter Notebook for combining code, visualizations, and explanations in one place.
